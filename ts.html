* Mathematical Methods: 
 ** Kreyszig Ch-7,8,9,10; Appendix-A3.4
# [[Newtonian Gravitation]]
 ## Gravity vs electrostatic force: Weak force but biggest player! 
  ##* ''"How heavy and how small" is what matters!''
  ## Derivation and use of ''Poisson's equation''.
	##  Two body problem in Newtonian gravity for the small body moving around massive object. Expressions for $$\frac{dr}{dt}, \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$ (later it will be contrasted with results using relativistic gravity); Bound and unbound systems; Stability of orbits. 
 ## Equations of hydrodynamics and Energy-momentum tensor in classical gravity: 
  ##* Construction of a star under hydrostatic equillibrium. 
 ## Virial theorem of collection of particles. 

# [[Special Relativity]]

 ## Using Lorentz transformation to realize and calculate length contraction, time dilation and other special relativistic effects.
 ## Minkowski's idea of 4D spacetime geometry -- world line, events and line interval. Line elements in pseudo-Euclidean geometry.
 ## Spacelike, timelike and null intervals and its invariance as proper time-interval.
 ## Derivation of Lorentz boost in one direction and relation with the nature of hyperbolic geometry.
 ##  Writing Lorentz transformation as matrix form.
 ## Principle of least action: writing Lagrangian for relativistic and non-relativistic systems.
  ##* importance of boundary conditions. 
 ## Statements and examples of ''Lorentz Covariance''
 ## Please derive the classical equations of hydrodynamics starting from a more general conservation equation that is of ''energy-momentum'' tensor ($$T_{\mu\nu}$$) of relativistic flow with the definition of energy-momentum tensor as $$T_{\mu\nu} = (p+\epsilon)u^\mu u^\nu + pg^{\mu\nu} $$ (''Why this form the most general for an ideal fluid?'') Show correspondence with classical notion of energy-momentum tensor i.e. mass density, internal energy density, momentum fluxes <<ref [[Poisson and Will 2014]]>>.

!!! ''Week-3,4'': Origins of General Relativity

 #* [Preclass]: https://youtu.be/P11Txh5C1UI: lectures by Prof. G. Srinivasan.
 ## Using Galilean transformation to obtain transformation of elementary physical quantities such as velocity, acceleration, energy between two inertial reference frames. 
  ##* ''How does equations change in non-inertial reference frames? Do they look same in two different accelerated reference frames?''
 
 ## ''Equivalence Principle:'' Equality between gravitational and inertial masses. Newton's argument and Einstein's extension as Weak Equivalence Principle. 
  ##* Meaning of "locally flat". 
 ## Writing line element (distance between two nearby points) in orthogonal systems such as Cartesian system: $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$, cylindrical and spherical. Identifying all the components of metric tensor and variation of unit vector along a curve. 
 ## Obtaining the components of metric tensor in cylindrical/spherical coordinates using metric tensor in Cartesian system and a given transformation law between these systems and vice-versa.
